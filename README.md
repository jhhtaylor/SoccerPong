# SoccerPong
IT PAT 2016 Entered into IT Showcase

My program is a twist on the classic game Pong, involving two vertically moving paddles (players) on opposite sides of the screen hitting 
a moving soccer ball back and forth between the two paddles. The game itself will be controlled using the 'w' and 's' keys for movement of 
player 1 and the 'up' and 'down' keys for movement of player 2. Once the ball goes behind the player one’s paddle (left hand side of the 
screen), player 2 gets a point. If player one hits the ball behind the player two’s paddle (right hand side of the screen), the player one 
gets a point. This will happen until either player 1 or 2 scores 3 points and the winner is displayed on the screen. 

The menus will be navigated using specific keys e.g. Press ‘P’ to play. This will be achieved using simple GUIs (Graphical User 
Interfaces) displayed to the user in the form of interconnected menus and screens. Text files will be used for storing data for scores and 
player login information. This will be elaborated on below.
